1. **Devin Nunes met last year with ousted Ukrainian prosecutor general Victor Shokin to discuss digging up dirt on Joe Biden**, according to Lev Parnas. An attorney for Parnas, an associate of Rudy Giuliani who has been indicted on federal campaign finance charges, says Parnas is willing to testify under oath that Nunes met with Shokin in Vienna last December. Parnas also plans to testify that aids to Nunes called off another planned trip to Ukraine this year when they found out they would have to report it to Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff. The purpose of the planned trip, according to Parnas, was to interview two Ukrainian prosecutors who said they had evidence that could help Trump get reelected. When Nunes' aides realized they would have to report the meetings to Schiff, they canceled the trip and held the meetings on Skype or over the phone instead. Nunes says the claims are "demonstrably false."

2. **Lev Parnas gave audio recordings, videos, and photos of Trump and Giuliani to the House Intelligence Committee**. There are no specific details available regarding what is depicted in the tapes and photos. The House committees in charge of the impeachment inquiry only began reviewing the materials last week. Both Schiff and an attorney for Parnas refused to elaborate on the contents of the materials, but they did confirm that Parnas has been cooperating with House investigators.

3. **The White House engaged in an extensive effort to come up with an after-the-fact justification for Trump's decision to withhold nearly $400 million in U.S. military aid to Ukraine**. A confidential White House review of the decision turned up hundreds of documents that show an internal debate over whether the move was legal, as well as email exchanges in early August between acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney and White House budget officials attempting to settle on an explanation after the hold had already been ordered. The review found that Trump made the decision to withhold the aid in July "without an assessment of reasoning or legal justification."

4. **Defense Secretary Mark Esper fired Navy Secretary Richard Spencer over Spencer's handling of convicted war criminal Eddie Gallagher's** **court case**. Trump intervened and ordered the Navy to restore his rank after Gallagher was convicted and demoted for posing with the corpse of a teenaged ISIS fighter and taking a photo. Esper ordered the Navy to also allow Gallagher to remain in the SEALs. Spencer tried to arrange a side deal with the White House to let Gallagher remain a SEAL, even while Spencer was arguing in public and with Pentagon officials for a disciplinary hearing. When Esper found out about the side dealings, he demanded Spencer's resignation and issued a statement that he lost "trust and confidence" in Spencer "regarding his lack of candor over conversations with the White House."
